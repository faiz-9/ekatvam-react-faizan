So I have completed this project:-

FIRSTLY - Only Signup and Login pages would be accessible, there is form validation in both, and after logging any details, a user will be redirected to dashboard.

And in dashboard, there will be all the features that were mentioned to be done, and also there is a Logout Feature, I have implemented this as a kind of Normal Login logout cases features, so a user can logout and will be redirected to the signup page.
